It includes everything from textbooks on theory to links to cool demos. I made this so I could have my own go-to list of great ML resources. I hope you find it useful. To put it simply, ML4 is for learning ML. How this resource is organized ML4 is split into three verbs for learning about ML: read, watch, and code. Click on the banners below to explore each page. Help improve ML4 Not finding what you are looking for? Have a great resource I should add? Consider helping improve ML4 by submitting a pull request to the github page. Don’t understand that last sentence? There’s a page on how you can contribute to ML4. Merch Want to show off your love of ML4? ML4 merch is available on Teespring. Hope you enjoy and thanks for supporting ML4.

["contribute.html", "Contribute to this Resource Why contribute? Ways you can contribute", " Contribute to this Resource Why contribute? I don’t want ML4 to be just another resource. Rather, I want it to be your resource. If there are things that trip you up or cause you frustration, chances are you’re not alone. Everyone comes to this resource with different backgrounds and expertise. Being able to collect all that knowledge in one place is this resource’s mission and you can help move that mission forward. Ways you can contribute There are three main ways to contribute: For simple changes contribute directly (Click at the top of any page to get started; just tap &amp; type) For bigger/more abstract suggestions submit an issue (very simple, much appreciated) For adventurous/social GitHub users solve an open issue (more advanced/open-ended, also much appreciated) For more info on how to contribute to a project like this, there’s a much more thorough contribute page on another resource I made called edav.info/. Thanks for helping improve ML4. "]
