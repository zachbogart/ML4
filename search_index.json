["contribute.html", "Contribute to this Resource Overview Why contribute? Ways you can contribute", " Contribute to this Resource Overview This page explains how to contribute to ML4. Why contribute? I don’t want ML to be just another resource. Rather, we want it to be your resource. If there are things that trip you up or cause you frustration, chances are you’re not alone. Everyone comes to this course with different backgrounds and expertise. Being able to collect all that knowledge in one place is this resource’s mission and you can help move that mission forward. Ways you can contribute There are three main ways to contribute: For simple changes contribute directly (we got a full walkthrough on how to do this) For bigger/more abstract suggestions submit an issue (very simple, much appreciated) For adventurous/social GitHub users solve an open issue (more advanced/open-ended, also much appreciated) Happy coding!
