# Contribute to this Resource {#contribute}

## Why contribute?

I don't want *ML4* to be just another resource. Rather, I want it to be *your* resource. If there are things that trip you up or cause you frustration, chances are you're not alone. Everyone comes to this resource with different backgrounds and expertise. Being able to collect all that knowledge in one place is this resource's mission and you can help move that mission forward.

## Ways you can contribute

There are **three main ways** to contribute: 

- <i class="fas fa-edit"></i> For **simple changes** <i class="fas fa-arrow-right"></i> **contribute directly** (Click <i class="fas fa-edit"></i> at the top of any page to get started; just tap & type)
- <i class="fas fa-sticky-note"></i> For **bigger/more abstract suggestions** <i class="fas fa-arrow-right"></i> [**submit an issue**](https://github.com/zachbogart/ML4/issues/new){target="_blank"} (very simple, much appreciated)
- <i class="fas fa-code-branch"></i> For **adventurous/social GitHub users** <i class="fas fa-arrow-right"></i> [**solve an open issue**](https://github.com/zachbogart/ML4/issues){target="_blank"} (more advanced/open-ended, also much appreciated)

For more info on how to contribute to a project like this, there's [a much more thorough contribute page](https://edav.info/contribute.html){target="_blank"} on another resource I made called [edav.info/](https://edav.info/){target="_blank"}.

Thanks for helping improve *ML4*.
